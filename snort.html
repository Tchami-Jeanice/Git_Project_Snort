    <h1>SNORT</h1>
    is an open-source network intrusion detection and prevention system (IDS/IPS) developed by Cisco.
    It is designed to detect and prevent a wide range of attacks and malicious activities by analyzing network traffic
    in real time.

    Here are some key features and characteristics of Snort:

    <h2> KEY FEATURES</h2>

   <p> -<strong>Real-Time Traffic Analysis: </strong> Snort captures and analyzes packets in real time, enabling immediate
    detection of suspicious activities.</p>

    <p>- <strong>Protocol Analysis: </strong> It understands various network protocols, allowing it to inspect and
    interpret traffic accurately.</p>

    <p>- <strong>Signature-Based Detection</strong>: Snort uses a set of predefined rules to identify known attack
    patterns.</p>
    <p>
    <h2>Users can also create custom rules for specific needs.</h2></p>

    <p><strong>Flexible Deployment: </strong> Snort can be deployed in various modes, including:</p>
    <p><strong>Sniffer Mode:</strong> Captures and displays packet data.</p>
    <p><strong> Packet Logger Mode:</strong> Logs packets to disk for later analysis.</p>
    <p><strong>Network Intrusion Detection System Mode:</strong> Analyzes traffic and raises alerts based on rule matches.</p>

    <p>
    The five basic rule types in Snort are
    <strong>-Alert rules: </strong> Snort generates an alert when a suspicious packet is detected.:</p>

    <p><strong>-Block rules: </strong>: Snort blocks the suspicious packet and all subsequent packets in the network flow.</p>
    <p><strong>-Drop rules:</strong> Snort drops the packet as soon as the alert is generated.</p>
    <p><strong>-Logging rules: </strong> Snort logs the packet as soon as the alert is generated.</p>
    <p><strong>-Pass rules: </strong> Snort ignores the suspicious packet and marks it as passed.</p>
