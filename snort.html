    <h1>SNORT</h1>
    is an open-source network intrusion detection and prevention system (IDS/IPS) developed by Cisco.
    It is designed to detect and prevent a wide range of attacks and malicious activities by analyzing network traffic
    in real time.

    Here are some key features and characteristics of Snort:

    <h2> KEY FEATURES</h2>

    -<strong>Real-Time Traffic Analysis: </strong> Snort captures and analyzes packets in real time, enabling immediate
    detection of suspicious activities.

    - <strong>Protocol Analysis: </strong> It understands various network protocols, allowing it to inspect and
    interpret traffic accurately.

    - <strong>Signature-Based Detection</strong>: Snort uses a set of predefined rules to identify known attack
    patterns.
    <h2>Users can also create custom rules for specific needs.</h2>

    <strong>Flexible Deployment: </strong> Snort can be deployed in various modes, including:
    <strong>Sniffer Mode:</strong> Captures and displays packet data.
    <strong> Packet Logger Mode:</strong> Logs packets to disk for later analysis.
    <strong>Network Intrusion Detection System Mode:</strong> Analyzes traffic and raises alerts based on rule matches.

    The five basic rule types in Snort are:
    <strong>-Alert rules: </strong> Snort generates an alert when a suspicious packet is detected.

    <strong>-Block rules: </strong>: Snort blocks the suspicious packet and all subsequent packets in the network flow.
    <strong>-Drop rules:</strong> Snort drops the packet as soon as the alert is generated.
    <strong>-Logging rules: </strong> Snort logs the packet as soon as the alert is generated.
    <strong>-Pass rules: </strong> Snort ignores the suspicious packet and marks it as passed.
